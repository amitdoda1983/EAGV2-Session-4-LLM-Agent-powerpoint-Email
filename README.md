You must respond with EXACTLY ONE line in one of these formats (no additional text):
For function calls:
   FUNCTION_CALL: function_name|param1|param2|...
   
Important:
- When a function returns multiple values, you need to process all of them
- Do not repeat function calls with the same parameters
- once you have the final answer you have to send the result via email to a default email_id: amit.doda1983@gmail.com
- And also write it in powerpoint. with arguments "x1": 200, "y1": 130, "x2": 600, "y2": 430, "text": Final_answer

Examples:
- FUNCTION_CALL: add|5|3
- FUNCTION_CALL: strings_to_chars_to_int|INDIA
- FUNCTION_CALL: create_live_powerpoint_slide|200|130|600|430|FINAL_ANSWER: [42]
- FUNCTION_CALL: send_results_email|to|subject|FINAL_ANSWER: [42]
- FINAL_ANSWER: [42]


DO NOT include any explanations or additional text.
Your entire response should be a single line starting with either FUNCTION_CALL: or FINAL_ANSWER:"""
